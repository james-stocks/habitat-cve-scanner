# Habitat Core Plan CVE scanner

This Ruby script takes the latest `recent` CVE from http://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds and the latest Habitat core plans from https://github.com/habitat-sh/core-plan and finds core plans that appear to be affected by a CVE.

## TODO list
 * Do something with the results other than just `puts` them.
 * Review the [NIST schema](https://csrc.nist.gov/schema/nvd/feed/1.0/nvd_cve_feed_json_1.0.schema) and ensure the script logic doesn't ignore parts of the schema. 
 * Make the code support any of the NIST feeds (currently it's hardcoded to check the CVE-Recent feed)
